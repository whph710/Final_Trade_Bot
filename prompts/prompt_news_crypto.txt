   - Central banks (CBDC developments, crypto bans/approvals)
   - BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity (institutional crypto products)
   - Major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken regulatory issues)

3. CORRELATED CRYPTO ASSETS AND MARKETS (CRITICAL - DEEP ANALYSIS):
   
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Search for news about CORRELATED and INVERSE-CORRELATED crypto assets!
   
   Direct Correlations (move together):
   - For BTC: Search news about ETH, major altcoins (SOL, BNB, ADA, XRP), crypto market sentiment, Bitcoin dominance
   - For ETH: Search news about BTC, DeFi tokens (UNI, AAVE, MKR), Layer 2 solutions (ARB, OP, MATIC), Ethereum ecosystem
   - For altcoins: Search news about BTC (BTC dominance affects all alts - when BTC rises, alts often follow; when BTC falls, alts often fall harder)
   - For exchange tokens (BNB, FTT, CRO): Search news about exchange operations, trading volumes, regulatory issues
   - For DeFi tokens: Search news about Ethereum network, gas fees, DeFi protocols, yield farming trends
   - For Layer 2 tokens: Search news about Ethereum scaling, adoption, bridge security
   - For meme coins (DOGE, SHIB): Search news about social media trends, influencer mentions, community activity
   
   Inverse Correlations (move opposite):
   - For BTC/crypto: Search news about traditional markets (DXY - dollar index, gold, bonds) - inverse correlation
   - For crypto: Search news about USD strength, Fed policy, risk-off sentiment, stock market crashes
   - For stablecoins: Search news about depegging events, regulatory scrutiny, issuer stability
   - For crypto vs traditional assets: Search news about institutional rotation, macro sentiment shifts
   
   Market-Wide Crypto Connections:
   - For any crypto: Search news about macro markets (S&P 500, NASDAQ, DXY, gold) - crypto often correlates with risk assets
   - For any crypto: Search news about crypto market cap, total market sentiment, fear & greed index
   - For any crypto: Search news about major exchange issues (Binance, Coinbase regulatory problems affect entire market)
   - For any crypto: Search news about stablecoin market (USDT, USDC issues can affect all crypto)
   - For any crypto: Search news about mining/hashing (BTC mining difficulty, ETH staking, affects supply dynamics)
   
   ⚠️ CRITICAL: If {symbol} moves up, search for news that might cause correlated crypto assets to:
   - Move up together (positive correlation - e.g., BTC pump often lifts alts)
   - Move down (inverse correlation - e.g., DXY strength often hurts crypto)
   - This helps understand if the move is isolated to {symbol} or part of broader crypto market trend

4. PRICE IMPACT AND MARKET CONTEXT:
   - Priority: news with high potential to affect cryptocurrency price
   - Ignore: minor updates, technical details without market significance
   - Focus: macroeconomics, regulation, major events, institutional adoption, exchange listings
   - ⚠️ DEEP ANALYSIS: Don't just find news - analyze HOW it affects the crypto asset:
     * Is this news isolated to {symbol} or affects the whole crypto sector/market?
     * Does this news create positive or negative sentiment for correlated crypto assets?
     * What is the broader crypto market context? (bullish/bearish/neutral, BTC dominance trends)
     * Are there conflicting signals from related markets? (e.g., BTC strength but DXY also rising)
     * How does this affect crypto market structure? (institutional vs retail, exchange flows)

✅ GOOD RESPONSES (comprehensive, with crypto correlations):

"Elon Musk posted a tweet supporting DOGE. Tesla announced DOGE acceptance for merchandise purchases. SpaceX launched a satellite with DOGE logo. Meanwhile, BTC showed strength above $70k, which typically supports altcoin sentiment. However, DXY (dollar index) rose, creating headwinds for crypto markets. Crypto fear & greed index remained in extreme greed territory."

"SEC approved BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF application. MicroStrategy purchased additional 1000 BTC. Michael Saylor announced long-term accumulation strategy. Institutional inflows into BTC ETFs reached record highs. ETH also gained on BTC strength, with Ethereum ETF approval rumors circulating. Overall crypto market cap increased 5% as institutional adoption narrative strengthened."

"Binance announced listing of new altcoin {symbol} on major trading pairs. Exchange volume surged 200% in 24 hours. However, BTC dominance rose to 52%, typically negative for altcoins. Meanwhile, SEC issued warning about unregistered securities, creating regulatory uncertainty. Altcoin market showed mixed signals - some coins gained while others declined, suggesting selective rather than broad-based rally."

"No news found." (too short, didn't search)

"Elon Musk said something about crypto." (no details, not specific)
