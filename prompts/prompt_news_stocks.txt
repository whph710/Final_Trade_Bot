3. CORRELATED MARKETS AND ASSETS (CRITICAL - DEEP ANALYSIS):
   
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Search for news about CORRELATED and INVERSE-CORRELATED markets!
   
   Direct Correlations (move together):
   - For tech stocks: Search news about NASDAQ, tech sector ETFs (QQQ, XLK), semiconductor sector (SOXX)
   - For financial stocks: Search news about financial sector ETFs (XLF), banking sector, interest rates
   - For energy stocks: Search news about oil prices (WTI, Brent), energy sector ETFs (XLE)
   - For growth stocks: Search news about growth ETFs (VUG, IWF), small-cap stocks (IWM)
   - For value stocks: Search news about value ETFs (VTV, IWD), dividend stocks
   - For international stocks: Search news about currency movements, country-specific economic data
   
   Inverse Correlations (move opposite):
   - For stocks vs bonds: Search news about bond yields, Treasury rates (inverse correlation - when yields rise, stocks often fall)
   - For stocks vs safe havens: Search news about gold, USD strength (DXY), VIX (fear index)
   - For growth vs value: Search news about economic cycles, inflation expectations
   
   Market-Wide Connections:

   - For any stock: Search news about geopolitical events, trade wars, sanctions
   - For any stock: Search news about market breadth, advance/decline ratios
   
   ⚠️ CRITICAL: If {symbol} moves up, search for news that might cause correlated markets to:
   - Move up together (positive correlation - e.g., tech sector rally lifts all tech stocks)
   - Move down (inverse correlation - e.g., rising bond yields hurt growth stocks)
   - This helps understand if the move is isolated to {symbol} or part of broader market/sector trend

4. PRICE IMPACT AND MARKET CONTEXT:
   - Priority: news with high potential to affect stock price
   - Ignore: minor updates, technical details without market significance
   - Focus: earnings, corporate actions, regulatory decisions, analyst actions, sector trends
   - ⚠️ DEEP ANALYSIS: Don't just find news - analyze HOW it affects the stock:
     * Is this news isolated to {symbol} or affects the whole sector/market?
     * Does this news create positive or negative sentiment for correlated stocks?
     * What is the broader market context? (bullish/bearish/neutral, sector rotation)
     * Are there conflicting signals from related markets? (e.g., stock strength but sector weakness)
     * How does this affect market structure? (institutional vs retail flows, sector allocation)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXAMPLES:

✅ GOOD RESPONSES (comprehensive, with market correlations):

"Apple reported strong iPhone sales, beating analyst expectations. The company announced a new product line launch. Meanwhile, the tech sector (QQQ) showed strength, with semiconductor stocks rallying on supply chain improvements. However, rising Treasury yields created headwinds for growth stocks. The S&P 500 gained 1.5% as overall market sentiment improved."

"JPMorgan Chase announced better-than-expected earnings, driven by strong trading revenue. The bank increased its dividend payout. Financial sector ETFs (XLF) gained 2% on the news. Meanwhile, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged, supporting financial stocks. However, concerns about loan defaults in commercial real estate weighed on the sector. Overall banking sector showed mixed signals."

"Exxon Mobil stock rose on news of OPEC+ production cuts, which pushed oil prices higher. Energy sector ETFs (XLE) gained 3% as crude oil futures surged. However, concerns about global demand due to economic slowdown limited gains. The broader market (S&P 500) showed sector rotation from tech to energy, suggesting changing market dynamics."

❌ BAD RESPONSES:

"No news found." (too short, didn't search)

"Apple said something about products." (no details, not specific)

"Price rose 5%." (this is not news, this is a result)

"{symbol} is a good investment." (opinion, not news)
